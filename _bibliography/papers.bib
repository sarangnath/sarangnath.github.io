abstract = {It is shown by analysis of a cyclic enzymatic network that the presence of zero net flux/current cycles impose strong thermodynamic constraints on the values of the kinetic parameters. Thermodynamic analysis is carried out for the four-node pyramidal reaction network involving the conversion of 7,8-­dihydrofolate (H2F) and NADPH in the presence of H+ to 5,6,7,8-­tetrahydrofolate (H4F) and NADP+ catalyzed by the universal enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The complete set of empty reaction routes in the DHFR pathway is identified, equations for the thermodynamic constraints imposed on the rate constants of the various elementary steps are written down, and the thermodynamic consistency of the experimentally determined rate constants is evaluated. The visual approach based on the theory of graphs can be employed to test the thermodynamic consistency of kinetic parameters of general cyclic enzyme-catalyzed reaction networks.}

The circuit analog is then simulated to elucidate the dynamics of complex cyclic bionetworks. The pyramidal reaction network catalyzed by the universal enzyme dihydrofolate reductase – which has important pharmacological and medical relevance in connection with cancer therapy – is used to illustrate the application of our model. The finite number of mechanisms, sub-cycles, or graphs constituting the cyclic network are analyzed, their contribution to the overall steady-state reaction rate determined, and the most probable mechanism is identified. The developed methodology is elegant, modular, and permits representation and visualization of network structure and topology at a glance. It can handle linear and nonlinear kinetics/rate laws, does not require simplifying assumptions such as use of the quasi-steady-state/Bodenstein approximation or the absence of nonlinear kinetic steps in the intermediates, and is suitable for coupling and integration with other flux-based reaction models.}

Here, a general methodology is formulated to convert an arbitrary reaction network into its equivalent electrical analog. The topological equivalence of the electrical analog is mathematically established for unimolecular reactions using Kirchhoff's laws. The modular approach is generalized to bimolecular and nonlinear autocatalytic reactions. It is then applied to simulate the dynamics of nonlinear autocatalytic networks without making simplifying assumptions, such as use of the quasi-steady state/Bodenstein approximation or the absence of nonlinear steps in the intermediates. This is among the few papers that quantify the dynamics of a nonlinear chemical reaction network by generating and simulating an electrical network analog. As a realistic biological application, the early phase of the spread of COVID-19 is modeled as an autocatalytic process and the predicted dynamics are in good agreement with experimental data. The rate-limiting step of viral transmission is identified, leading to novel mechanistic insights.}

We quantify the dynamics of a minimal model by linear stability techniques and direct integration of the set of ODEs, and show that essential oscillatory and excitability features are satisfactorily captured.

    abstract = { The ATP−ADP thermodynamic cycle is the fundamental mode of energy exchange in oxidative phosphorylation, photophosphorylation, muscle contraction, and intracellular transport by various molecular motors and is therefore of vital importance in biological energy transduction and storage. Following a recent suggestion in the pages of this journal (Ross, J. J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 6987−6990), we have carried out a simple quantitative analysis of a direct molecular mechanism of energy transfer from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The simulation provides new insights into the mechanistic events following terminal phosphorus−oxygen bond cleavage during ATP hydrolysis. This approach also allows for the division of the energy-transfer process into elementary steps and for the prediction of the distribution of the standard-state Gibbs free energy of the overall ATP hydrolysis process among the various steps of substrate binding, bond cleavage, and product release in the enzymatic cycle, which had proved very difficult to specify previously. These predictions are consistent with available experimental data on ATP hydrolysis by protein biomolecular machines. The fundamental biological implications arising from our results are also discussed in detail. The aspects considered in this work enable us to look at the entire process of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and energy transduction and storage in various biological molecular machines in a logically consistent and unified way. }

We propose a novel slice-to-volume registration method using Transformers trained on synthetically transformed data, which model multiple stacks of MR slices as a sequence. With the attention mechanism, our model automatically detects the relevance between slices and predicts the transformation of one slice using information from other slices. We also estimate the underlying 3D volume to assist slice-to-volume registration and update the volume and transformations alternately to improve accuracy. Results on synthetic data show that our method achieves lower registration error and better reconstruction quality compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. Experiments with real-world MRI data are also performed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to improve the quality of 3D reconstruction under severe fetal motion.",

abstract = {Purpose: Fetal brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging suffers from unpredictable and unconstrained fetal motion that causes severe image artifacts even with half-Fourier single-shot fast spin echo (HASTE) readouts. This work presents the implementation of a closed-loop pipeline that automatically detects and reacquires HASTE images that were degraded by fetal motion without any human interaction. Methods: A convolutional neural network that performs automatic image quality assessment (IQA) was run on an external GPU-equipped computer that was connected to the internal network of the MRI scanner. The modified HASTE pulse sequence sent each image to the external computer, where the IQA convolutional neural network evaluated it, and then the IQA score was sent back to the sequence. At the end of the HASTE stack, the IQA scores from all the slices were sorted, and only slices with the lowest scores (corresponding to the slices with worst image quality) were reacquired. Results: The closed-loop HASTE acquisition framework was tested on 10 pregnant mothers, for a total of 73 acquisitions of our modified HASTE sequence. The IQA convolutional neural network, which was successfully employed by our modified sequence in real time, achieved an accuracy of 85.2\% and area under the receiver operator characteristic of 0.899. Conclusion: The proposed acquisition/reconstruction pipeline was shown to successfully identify and automatically reacquire only the motion degraded fetal brain HASTE slices in the prescribed stack. This minimizes the overall time spent on HASTE acquisitions by avoiding the need to repeat the entire stack if only few slices in the stack are motion-degraded.},

abstract="Fetal brain MRI is useful for diagnosing brain abnormalities but is challenged by fetal motion. The current protocol for T2-weighted fetal brain MRI is not robust to motion so image volumes are degraded by inter- and intra- slice motion artifacts. Besides, manual annotation for fetal MR image quality assessment are usually time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, a semi-supervised deep learning method that detects slices with artifacts during the brain volume scan is proposed. Our method is based on the mean teacher model, where we not only enforce consistency between student and teacher models on the whole image, but also adopt an ROI consistency loss to guide the network to focus on the brain region. The proposed method is evaluated on a fetal brain MR dataset with 11,223 labeled images and more than 200,000 unlabeled images. Results show that compared with supervised learning, the proposed method can improve model accuracy by about 6{\%} and outperform other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. The proposed method is also implemented and evaluated on an MR scanner, which demonstrates the feasibility of online image quality assessment and image reacquisition during fetal MR scans.",

abstract="The performance and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy is fundamentally constrained by fetal motion. Motion of the fetus, which is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional imaging times, limits the set of viable acquisition techniques to single-shot imaging with severe compromises in signal-to-noise ratio and diagnostic contrast, and frequently results in unacceptable image quality. Surprisingly little is known about the characteristics of fetal motion during MRI and here we propose and demonstrate methods that exploit a growing repository of MRI observations of the gravid abdomen that are acquired at low spatial resolution but relatively high temporal resolution and over long durations (10--30 min). We estimate fetal pose per frame in MRI volumes of the pregnant abdomen via deep learning algorithms that detect key fetal landmarks. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that our framework achieves quantitatively an average error of 4.47 mm and 96.4{\%} accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). Fetal pose estimation in MRI time series yields novel means of quantifying fetal movements in health and disease, and enables the learning of kinematic models that may enhance prospective mitigation of fetal motion artifacts during MRI acquisition.",

abstract="Fetal MRI is heavily constrained by unpredictable and substantial fetal motion that causes image artifacts and limits the set of viable diagnostic image contrasts. Current mitigation of motion artifacts is predominantly performed by fast, single-shot MRI and retrospective motion correction. Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used to fully exploit physical structure. Evaluation of this method on a repository of 3-mm resolution in vivo data demonstrates a mean accuracy of landmark estimation 10 mm of ground truth as 87.3{\%}, and a mean error of 6.9 mm. The proposed DRL for fetal pose landmark search demonstrates a potential clinical utility for online detection of fetal motion that guides real-time mitigation of motion artifacts as well as health diagnosis during MRI of the pregnant mother.",

abstract="Fetal motion is the dominant challenge to reliable performance and diagnostic quality of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The fetus can move unpredictably and rapidly, leading to severe image artifacts. Consequently, MR acquisitions are largely limited to so-called single-shot techniques in an attempt to ``freeze'' fetal motion through fast imaging, while the problem due to motion occur between slices still exists. In this work, we propose a deep learning method for fetal pose estimation from MR volumes using the paradigm of conditional generative adversarial network which consists of two networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator is responsible for estimating keypoint heatmaps from input MRI and the discriminator tries to learn the features of plausible fetal pose and distinguish ground-truth heatmaps from generated ones. With this adversarial training scheme, the generator can robustly produce realistic heatmaps for fetal pose inference. Besides, we use adaptive variance to model the difference in intensity of motion of different keypoints. Evaluation shows that the proposed method can improve the performance of pose estimation in 3D MRI, achieving quantitatively an average error of 2.64 mm and 98.31{\%} accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). The proposed method can process volumes with latency less than 300 ms, potentially enabling low-latency online tracking of fetal pose during MR scans.",

  abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used in various clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, heart disease and neuro disorders. The use of radioactive tracer in PET imaging raises concerns due to the risk of radiation exposure. To minimize this potential risk in PET imaging, efforts have been made to reduce the amount of radio-tracer usage. However, lowing dose results in low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and loss of information, both of which will heavily affect clinical diagnosis. Besides, the ill-conditioning of low-dose PET image reconstruction makes it a difficult problem for iterative reconstruction algorithms. Previous methods proposed are typically complicated and slow, yet still cannot yield satisfactory results at significantly low dose. Here, we propose a deep learning method to resolve this issue with an encoder-decoder residual deep network with concatenate skip connections. Experiments shows the proposed method can reconstruct low-dose PET image to a standard-dose quality with only two-hundredth dose. Different cost functions for training model are explored. Multi-slice input strategy is introduced to provide the network with more structural information and make it more robust to noise. Evaluation on ultra-low-dose clinical data shows that the proposed method can achieve better result than the state-of-the-art methods and reconstruct images with comparable quality using only 0.5% of the original regular dose.}

One hundredth of the raw list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1\%) acquisition. Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for reading results.ResultsThe synthesized images (especially from the PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose image. All PET-plus-MR images scored 3 or higher, with proportions of images rated greater than 3 similar to those for the full-dose images (−10\% difference [eight of 80 readings], 95\% CI: −15\%, −5\%). Accuracy for amyloid status was high (71 of 80 readings [89\%]) and similar to intrareader reproducibility of full-dose images (73 of 80 [91\%]). The PET-plus-MR model also had the smallest mean and variance for SUVR difference to full-dose images.ConclusionSimultaneously acquired MRI and ultra–low-dose PET data can be used to synthesize full-dose–like amyloid PET images.© RSNA, 2018Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Catana in this issue. }

  abstract={Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used molecular imaging modality for various clinical applications. With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) providing anatomical information, simultaneous PET/MR reduces the radiation risk. Both improved hardware and algorithms have been developed to further reduce the amount of radiotracer dosage, but these methods are not yet applied to very low dose. Here, we propose a Deep Learning based method to enable ultra-low-dose PET denoising with multi-contrast information from simultaneous MRI. Methods:The method is implemented to denoise 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain PET images from low-dose images with 200-fold dose reduction through undersampling, and evaluated for glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations were conducted to verify the performance and clinical applicability of the proposed method, including quantitative accuracy evaluation, visual quality evaluation, reader study with manual tumor segmentation to evaluate the diagnostic quality. Results:The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior results in performance and efficiency comparing with the state-of-art denoising methods. Conclusion:Though reconstructed from scans with only 0.5% of the standard dose, the denoised ultra-low-dose PET images deliver similar visual quality and diagnostic information as the standard-dose PET images. By combining PET and MR information, the proposed Deep Learning based method improves image quality of ultra-low-dose PET, preserves diagnostic quality, and potentially enables much safer, faster, and more cost-effective PET/MR studies.}

abstract="Fetal motion is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional MR scan times. Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods. To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data. Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.",

abstract="Image denoising is of great importance for medical imaging system, since it can improve image quality for disease diagnosis and downstream image analyses. In a variety of applications, dynamic imaging techniques are utilized to capture the time-varying features of the subject, where multiple images are acquired for the same subject at different time points. Although signal-to-noise ratio of each time frame is usually limited by the short acquisition time, the correlation among different time frames can be exploited to improve denoising results with shared information across time frames. With the success of neural networks in computer vision, supervised deep learning methods show prominent performance in single-image denoising, which rely on large datasets with clean-vs-noisy image pairs. Recently, several self-supervised deep denoising models have been proposed, achieving promising results without needing the pairwise ground truth of clean images. In the field of multi-image denoising, however, very few works have been done on extracting correlated information from multiple slices for denoising using self-supervised deep learning methods. In this work, we propose Deformed2Self, an end-to-end self-supervised deep learning framework for dynamic imaging denoising. It combines single-image and multi-image denoising to improve image quality and use a spatial transformer network to model motion between different slices. Further, it only requires a single noisy image with a few auxiliary observations at different time frames for training and inference. Evaluations on phantom and in vivo data with different noise statistics show that our method has comparable performance to other state-of-the-art unsupervised or self-supervised denoising methods and outperforms under high noise levels.",

abstract="Image registration plays an important role in medical image analysis. Conventional optimization based methods provide an accurate estimation due to the iterative process at the cost of expensive computation. Deep learning methods such as learn-to-map are much faster but either iterative or coarse-to-fine approach is required to improve accuracy for handling large motions. In this work, we proposed to learn a registration optimizer via a multi-scale neural ODE model. The inference consists of iterative gradient updates similar to a conventional gradient descent optimizer but in a much faster way, because the neural ODE learns from the training data to adapt the gradient efficiently at each iteration. Furthermore, we proposed to learn a modal-independent similarity metric to address image appearance variations across different image contrasts. We performed evaluations through extensive experiments in the context of multi-contrast 3D MR images from both public and private data sources and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods.",

  abstract = {Purpose: Training auto-encoders on simulated signal evolution and inserting the decoder into the forward model improves reconstructions through more compact, Bloch-equation-based representations of signal in comparison to linear subspaces. Methods: Building on model-based nonlinear and linear subspace techniques that enable reconstruction of signal dynamics, we train auto-encoders on dictionaries of simulated signal evolution to learn more compact, non-linear, latent representations. The proposed Latent Signal Model framework inserts the decoder portion of the auto-encoder into the forward model and directly reconstructs the latent representation. Latent Signal Models essentially serve as a proxy for fast and feasible differentiation through the Bloch-equations used to simulate signal. This work performs experiments in the context of T2-shuffling, gradient echo EPTI, and MPRAGE-shuffling. We compare how efficiently auto-encoders represent signal evolution in comparison to linear subspaces. Simulation and in-vivo experiments then evaluate if reducing degrees of freedom by inserting the decoder into the forward model improves reconstructions in comparison to subspace constraints. Results: An auto-encoder with one real latent variable represents FSE, EPTI, and MPRAGE signal evolution as well as linear subspaces characterized by four basis vectors. In simulated/in-vivo T2-shuffling and in-vivo EPTI experiments, the proposed framework achieves consistent quantitative NRMSE and qualitative improvement over linear approaches. From qualitative evaluation, the proposed approach yields images with reduced blurring and noise amplification in MPRAGE shuffling experiments. Conclusion: Directly solving for non-linear latent representations of signal evolution improves time-resolved MRI reconstructions through reduced degrees of freedom.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
